<h3>About Us</h3>
    
<h2>How We Came Together:</h2>
<p class="text">We came together in August 2016 as a new robotics club. As a group of unknown students gathered, we were introduced to our new mentors Ms. Wolf and Mr. Davies. Along with them were Joe Barry, the mentor of 987, Brandon Sellers, and Angela Quick, who were both strongly tied to FIRST Nevada. They introduced and aided us with everything there is to FIRST: the competitions, how everything works and if we ever needed their assistance, they were there to help. So with that, we grew to a strong club of 25 by the time of the 2016-2017 FRC SteamWorks.

<h2>About the Mentors:</h2>
<p class="text"><i>"The Robotics program is a highlight of the school.  They devote a lot of time both during school and after in order to be successful.  It is fun to watch them creating and troubleshooting during their class period in an active learning environment. Although it’s a lot of work, it’s a lot of fun too.  How many places can you say that you had to dodge a robot being driven down the hallway while walking to your classroom?  The learning in Robotics also extends to other courses as those students are better able to face challenges, work as teams, and remain focused.  This program is great for both the creative and analytical minded student to be able to show his or her skills and interests."</i> - Ms. Paxon
