<h3>Experiences</h3>

<h2>2016-2017:</h2>
<p class="text">During our build were capable of coming together as a team to create a bot that not only placed us in 21st place, but we won the Rookie Highest Seed and the Rookie All-Star Awards. To achieve this, we collaborated alongside each other, accomplishing the task at hand; working long hours to plan and build what was needed: all with the support of our sponsors and donations.</p>

<h2>2017-2018:</h2>
<p class="text">Strong with confidence, we wanted to push for more with who we were as a team. We wanted to get our name out and strive towards what we as members want. With that, we added more mechanisms for our bot, gave more to the FIRST Community, and outreached to other teams within Las Vegas. Once the competition came, our team was ready, and placed 26th and won the Dean’s List Award for our VP Josie Destefano.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
    <p class="text">Participating in the 2017 Las Vegas Regional as a rookie team was a transforming and educational experience for the students of the Vegas Vortechs. Valuable lessons were implemented including organization, time management, and respect. The members of the team were personally changed as a result from participating in FRC. They experienced positive changes in personality, attitude, maturity, and acquired a higher confidence when communicating with team members, adults, and reaching out to the community. A list of important lessons we picked up and carried with us throughout the season are as follows:</p>
<p class="text">
    <span class="orange">Dedication is required.</span> At the beginning of the season we did not understand the level of commitment needed to be successful. However, in a short time we realized we needed to ‘up our game’ and willingly put in the extra time after school and on weekends to accomplish our goals.</p>
<p class="text">
    <span class="orange">Manage our time.</span> We set up a Gantt Chart but we didn’t use it efficiently. Our main problem was that we waited for the next person to complete something, which showed to be quite inefficient. We knew that we were a part of a team, and that in order to get moving we needed to work in parallel. We all counted on each other, and in order to get the most work done as possible we needed to all be on the same page.</p>
<p class="text">
    <span class="orange">Speak up for ourselves.</span> In the beginning, most of the team members were shy. As the season went on we became more outspoken, and more willing to be open about ourselves to others. We soon saw each other as a family where we trusted and relied on each other. We brought out the best in each other.</p>
<p class="text">
    <span class="orange">Communication is key to a functioning team.</span> We experienced some problems due to not communicating with each other, and working at our own pace. Realizing this problem, we integrated a system where we learned to work in parallel and keep track of what other people are doing. We learned that we weren't just doing our part, but that we were all interconnected to each other to complete a larger goal. We learned to speak about any clarifications and learned how to talk to adults.</p>
<p class="text">
    <span class="orange">Have an active fundraising team.</span> We realized we spent so much time on putting a team and robot together, we neglected raising money to support the team.</p>
<p class="text">
    <span class="orange">Task management is important.</span> We had issues on who was doing which job and had to assign tasks so everyone knew what to do. We distributed the work throughout so everyone was working productively. One of our main problems was that someone would take up a job but never complete it. The team would end up waiting weeks until the task was done.</p>
<p class="text">
    <span class="orange">Be realistic with designs and ideas.</span>  We learned to be honest with our abilities.  We stretched ourselves but not too far to ensure our robot worked for the competition.  </p>
<p class="text">
    <span class="orange">We learned how to organize better.</span> We realized that we needed a better system of organization for the tools and inside the pit. We also decided to include checklists next time because we saw how efficient the system was working out for the other teams.</p>
<p class="text">
    <span class="orange">Training all members is important.</span> We are currently going to make a program to train students how to operate certain machines in the shop, so they could be certified for the machines, tools, and reiterate shop safety rules.</p>
<p class="text">
    <span class="orange">Learn the FRC rules.</span> When we were asked questions during the competition, we realized just how much we didn't know about the FRC rules.</p>
<p class="text">
    <span class="orange">This is OUR team.</span> This year the teachers were doing a lot of the leading and planning, and we decided that we needed to be able to run the club by ourselves. We will improve by taking over the tasks that the teachers and mentors were doing last year. New team members will shadow the veteran students to learn about FIRST and all that encompasses. Veterans will pass on information to ensure ALL members understand what being part of this team means. </p>
<p class="text">
    <span class="orange">What an opportunity we have.</span> Participating in the competition, we learned to appreciate the experience, values, and lessons of formal competition. We cheered the other teams on, practiced good sportsmanship, and learned to form alliances. Even if our alliance didn't win a match, we learned to still congratulate and be positive to the opposing alliance. Having a positive attitude and respect towards competitors was a great lesson learned throughout the competition.</p>
